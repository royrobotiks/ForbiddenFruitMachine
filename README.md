The player can control the apple with a joystick and by hitting the fire button, 
the player can let other creatures in the painting taste the forbidden fruit.

In this repository, you can find the Arduino codes for the Forbidden Fruit Machine.
Here is the schematic of the electronics: http://goo.gl/z6HXBq

The codes run on an Arduino UNO (main code) and on an Arduino Pro Mini (LED controller).
